# Experiment Plan

1. Reproduce baseline accuracy on GTSRB, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 without backdoor injection.
2. Introduce JPEG-conditioned triggers and measure attack success rate (ASR) against clean accuracy.
3. Evaluate mitigation strategies such as saliency-guided CutMix and two-phase training schedules.
4. Summarise findings in `outputs/metrics/summary.csv` and prepare figures in `outputs/figures/`.
